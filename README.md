# Hello there.
If you're reading this, you've probably been roped into working with CX CentEng on something exciting and interesting.

## Ground rules
There aren't many - essentially these are the key points:
* don't be an idiot
* respect others at all times
* never make anything public (for the time being)
* use agnostic naming (i.e. instead of 'Acme Inc. Secret Project To Sell 500 Ferrets', it's 'Ferret Generation System')
* don't delete if you're unsure
* and back things up regularly.

# What we're working on
## Proof of Concepts
Ideas turn into working demonstrations rapidly so we can show the value of the proposal, obtain buy-in and get early steering on features. These set us up for generating revenue by selling things that customers can use. (Or maybe we can use it internally ourselves).

## Revenue Generating Software Projects
More involved and time consuming than PoCs, these projects generate revenue and are customer (or internal) deliverables. We may also provide support after delivery. 

## Idea Jamming
Bringing together groups of individuals to form a temporary virtual team, faced with a problem statement or challenge. We create innovative ways out of this problem or challenge using a practised loose ideation framework. It's nothing new, but it's definitely more fun than the usual team meeting, and it's getting some useful results.
